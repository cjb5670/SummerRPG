FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:

List of buttons.

Button text is rewritten based on a list of moves each character has.
Initilize reads a text doc that holds the moves a character knows and adds them to a list. 
When a character learns a new move, it is added to the list. 

A save function writes a character's stats to a text doc with their name on it.

FOR ATTENTION NOW:

Info Box needs texture.
AddMove WPF needs to be edited so Descriptions fit on InfoBox (character limit
	before break)
	
Create better feedback for what is happening in the game.

Implement leveling up system, learning new moves, methods for animating menu moving,
 


KNOWN BUGS:
(possible solve) (reserach)		Monogame isn't loading audio files
Parcou still can cause out of range exception. Hide object instead of removing form list.
AddMove function having troubles with Substring and length out of bounds.
