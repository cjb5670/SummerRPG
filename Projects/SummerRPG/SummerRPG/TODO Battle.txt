FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:

List of buttons.

Button text is rewritten based on a list of moves each character has.
Initilize reads a text doc that holds the moves a character knows and adds them to a list. 
When a character learns a new move, it is added to the list. 

A save function writes a character's stats to a text doc with their name on it.

FOR ATTENTION NOW:

Info Box needs texture.
AddMove WPF needs to be edited so Descriptions fit on InfoBox (character limit
	before break)
	
Create feedback for what is happening in the game.

Allow for leveling up
Combatant that delivers the killing blow gets the EP. 
Levling up requires 100x the level being reached.
Each enemy provides 100XP * level
Reaching certain levels unlocks more powerful moves.
When your total moves exceeds 4, there is an arrow that allows you to scroll through moves



KNOWN BUGS:
(possible solve) (Implementation)	Remove Combatant (game1 Update) function 
sometimes repeats combatants
Soundeffect logic is playing, but not the actual sound.
Combat logic runs all at once, cannot be paused after certain events.
